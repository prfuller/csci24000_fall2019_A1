My name is Paice Fuller. I am a Junior in standing but that is mostly because i transfered a lot of credits from the military. Previously, I was a Russian/Ukranian Linguist. This class is part of my degree path. I completed the CS certificate prior to the military. I want to graduate and become a big boy.
